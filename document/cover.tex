All living beings store their genetic information in the DNA and use similar basic mechanisms to read it and, according to its sequence, build their structure and develop their functions. Nevertheless, the information codified on the DNA is not the only aspect that makes an organism what it is. A big and complex network of gene regulation determines which genes are read at a particular moment and the intensity of their activity making it possible, for instance, to differentiate between our muscle cells and our neurons, very different cells but with the same genetic material. Since gene expression is mediated by reactions between molecules, which at microscopic levels happen due to random collisions of the reactants, gene expression and regulation is subjected to noise. A cell also regulates the expression of many genes according to the environment, which may change randomly. In response to these important sources of noise, living beings have developed their regulatory networks to work properly under its presence. This work explores the models that have been done on the last years related to stochasticity in gene expression, the insights they have given to us into the principles of biology and the design of synthetic biological circuits.\par
